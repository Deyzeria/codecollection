# codecollection
This repository exists fully as my codes collection across different games. 

Idle Kattack is half finished pseudo-idle game. Due to the use of doubles calculations while small are incorrect.

Random Tasks is a collection of scripts without any links to the specific projects- those could be just scripts from different tasks teachers gave me or scripts which don't deserve to go into a specific game

Spirited is an endless runner. Math got extremely wonky, and, well, it started nice, but got extremely out of control and many many bugs.

The Ancient- a Darkest Dungeon parody. Includes a lot of links between different codes, because of which without knowing codes are quite unreadable, but featured a really nice system for creating new characters from scratch, as well as ability to control both heroes and monsters. Many bugs.

Visual Novel- the most working game to date. If I were to remake it now I would have done it differently, but each Dialogue needed to be filled manually, up to 100 dialogues per character. MyEditorClass goes into Editor folder and was mostly to hide and reveal different parts of Dialogue
